<p>I was born in the crook of a granite Boulder, high in the mountains of Ecuador, a few miles south of the city of Cuenca.</p>

<p>My mother named me Juan Alberto Dominguez Garcia Diaz Rodrigo. She weaned me early and I never knew my father.</p>

<p>Alone and aware of my stature, I spent much of early life hidden under the brush of the mountain foliage and in the shadows. I ate grass and drank from the afternoon showers.</p>

<p>One evening I was caught in a torrential downpour. I was terrified. Soaking wet, I walked in the dark, shivering, searching for a place to hide from the rain.</p>

<p>I met a pack of hairless animals that lived in above ground burrows (quite cozy). They fed me more food than I&#39;d ever had in my life.</p>

<p>I was gaunt, my coat was flea ridden and matted. They took me to a medicine man who took off all my hair, wetted me in a small waterfall, and poked me with shiny sticks.</p>

<p>They put a vine around my neck and tried to pull me down the road. Eventually they just picked me up and carried me.</p>

<p>Soon, I was in the belly of a large eagle. We spent a lot of time there. The eagle made my minder kinda grumpy, but I just slept<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>.</p>

<p>While walking to a different eagle I met an army dog who wore this totally bad ass black tactical vest.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning we arrived at &quot;The United States&quot;.</p>

<p>I like my new life. My minder got me a bed and some dolls to play with. He gives me a lot of food. It&#39;s way better than grass and I don&#39;t have to do anything to get it.</p>

<p>He squeezes me and smacks his lips on my head.</p>

<p>We go out to meet other dogs and when I take a dump he likes to pick it up and carry it<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>. But if I ever try to watch him take a dump he will push me away and hide it.</p>

<p>I thought I would die during the rain storm but instead it brought me to a new life full of warmth, love, and happiness.</p>

<p>I am Poncho.</p>
